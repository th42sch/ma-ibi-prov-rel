\chapter{Automated Retrieval of Provenance Relationships}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    develop method for answering queries in the model just defined
  \item
    uniform vs.\ distributed scenario:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        uniform: 
        
        data source graph is generated explicitly (using data integration techniques)
        and updated in fixed intervals
                
        provenance query is formulated as a \gls{SPARQL} query and posed against the graph
      \item
        distributed: 
        
        data source graph is implicit; data sources are queried \enquote{on the fly}
        (this is the preferred scenario here; see delineation from SoNAR in ยง\ref{sec:HNA+SoNAR})
        
        decompose query into single \gls{SPARQL} (sub)queries and pose them against several data sources,
        potentially iteratively;
        data sources need to be identified upfront.
        $\leadsto$ demonstrate this for example query/ies!
