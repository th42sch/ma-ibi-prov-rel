\chapter{Automated Retrieval of Provenance Relationships}
\label{chap:retrieval}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    develop method for answering queries in the model just defined
  \item
    online vs.\ off{}line scenario:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        off{}line: 
        
        data source graph is generated explicitly (using data integration techniques)
        and updated in fixed intervals
                
        at runtime: provenance query is formulated as a \gls{SPARQL} query and posed against the graph
      \item
        online: 
        
        data source graph is implicit; data sources are queried \enquote{on the fly}
        (this is the preferred scenario here; see delineation from SoNAR in ยง\ref{sec:HNA+SoNAR})
        
        data sources need to be defined and
        interactions with them programmed in advance
        
        at runtime: decompose query into single \gls{SPARQL} (sub)queries and pose them against several data sources,
        potentially iteratively;
        compose final answer from the partial answers
        $\leadsto$ demonstrate this for example query/ies!
