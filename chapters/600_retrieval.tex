\chapter{Automated Retrieval of Provenance Relationships}
\label{chap:retrieval}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    develop method for answering queries in the model just defined
  \item
    online vs.\ off{}line scenario:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        off{}line: 
        
        data source graph is generated explicitly (using data integration techniques)
        and updated in fixed intervals
                
        at runtime: provenance query is formulated as a \gls{SPARQL} query and posed against the graph
      \item
        online: 
        
        data source graph is implicit; data sources are queried \enquote{on the fly}
        (this is the preferred scenario here; see delineation from SoNAR in ยง\ref{sec:HNA+SoNAR})
        
        data sources need to be defined and
        interactions with them programmed in advance
        
        at runtime: decompose query into single \gls{SPARQL} (sub)queries and pose them against several data sources,
        potentially iteratively;
        compose final answer from the partial answers
        $\leadsto$ demonstrate this for example query/ies!
    \end{itemize}
    %
  \item
    get back to Section~\ref{sec:quality_of_answers}:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        missing vs.\ spurious answers
      \item
        overapproximation
      \item
        \emph{reasoning}: ontologies and related technology -- also explain why
        missing knowledge cannot be added upfront, e.g., like this:
        
        Clearly, it would not be advisable to attempt adding all implicit knowledge to the data
        because that would massively inflate the data,
        as most terms have several superordinate concepts or relations and,
        furthermore, implicit knowledge is not restricted to taxonomic knowledge.
      \item
        \emph{hypothesising}
    \end{itemize}
    %
  \item
    get back to substitute information (from SoNAR and Section~\ref{sec:quality_of_answers})
  \item
    indirect relationships
\end{itemize}
