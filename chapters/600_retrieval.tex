\chapter{A Method for Retrieving Provenance Relationships}
\label{chap:retrieval}
\label{chap:method}

In the previous chapter, 
we have developed a model for answering provenance queries.
It is the vision of this thesis that, ultimately,
this model is implemented 
in a retrieval system
that answers provenance queries conforming to our model.
The primary user group for that system consists of provenance researchers
and historians who want to investigate, for example, the history of
items and collections or the social networks of historically important figures.

In this chapter, we design a method that serves
as a the general basis for a retrieval system.
This method abstracts away from specific details such as 
programming paradigms, languages, libraries, or data structures;
instead, it represents a high-level specification
for future implementations.

In the discussion of the insights from the \gls{SoNAR} project
in Section~\ref{subsec:insights_from_SoNAR},
we have suggested a distinction between a dynamic and a static setting.
The method that we are going to develop should be flexible
and support both settings.
For this purpose, we make this distinction more explicit.
The \emph{static setting} resembles the setting used in the SoNAR project:
a large uniform data source \emph{(graph)} is constructed
from the various identified data sources \emph{(repositories)},
using a uniform data model and that integrates the heterogeneous data models
of the repositories in some way. This graph is 
used as the sole source for computing query answers.
In contrast, the \emph{dynamic setting} foregoes
the explicit construction of a uniform graph and instead
regards a collection of remote repositories as a representation of that
graph. In order to answer a query, the system identifies
suitable repositories, computes partial answers using the repositories' interfaces,
and composes the final answer from the partial answers.

Our method will consist of two main phases, the second of which is divided
into three subphases.
We describe these phases in Section~\ref{sec:phases}.
In Section~\ref{sec:dynamic_vs_static}, we take a closer look at the two settings.
Finally, we will discuss several aspects of the system's interaction with its users
in Section~\ref{sec:user_interaction}.

Our method consists of a \emph{Configuration Phase}, which
needs to be carried out before users can interact with the system,
and a \emph{Runtime Phase}, where the actual user interaction takes place.
The latter is divided into three subphases as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:method_phases},
which are traversed consecutively.
In the \emph{Query Formulation} phase, the system supports the user 
in constructing their query.
In the \emph{Query Processing} phase, the system evaluates the query
and computes answers.
In the \emph{Answer Presentation} phase, the system allows the user to
navigate through the computed answers.
Given the significance of an explorative approach to historical research
(see Section~\ref{subsec:SoNAR_reports}),
it is very likely that the answers presented by the system will 
result in the user wanting to reformulate their original query.
In fact, query answers can be seen as one means of support
for formulating a query in the first place.
For this reason, we prefer to understand the Runtime Phase as an iterative process,
which we indicate by the looping arrow in Figure~\ref{fig:method_phases}.

We now describe these phases in more detail.

\subsection{Configuration Phase}

The Configuration Phase consists of the steps that need to be taken
in order for the system to be able to interact with the user in the Runtime Phase.
The first step is the selection of repositories that are available 
throughout the Runtime Phase.
In the dynamic setting, where the graph is implicit in this collection of repositories,
it is necessary that the details of accessing each single repository
have been implemented.
In the static setting, the graph needs to be built from the repositories
and stored in memory, in a database system, or on some suitable storage medium.
As a final step, a list of terms (objects, concepts, relations) available in the graph
needs to be compiled. Ideally, each term should be annotated with the data source(s)
from which it originates, in order to trace it back for disambiguation and
other purposes.

\subsection{Runtime Phase}

The Runtime Phase is the phase in which the system receives queries from the user,
computes answers, and presents them to the user. It is thus divided into
three subphases.

% ...............................
\paragraph{Query Formulation.}

In the Query Formulation Phase, the user builds the query
to be answered. The system should support the user by providing a query editor.
Since we deliberately developed a graph-based model
for facilitating intuitive visual representations,
it makes perfect sense to offer a graphical interface
that allows the user to create nodes, draw edges between them,
and pick node names, node labels, and edge labels from the list of available terms.
For disambiguation purposes, it would be helpful to have an
integrated lookup functionality, i.e., the entry for a system
in the original repository could be displayed in the system
without switching to another application.

If ternary relations or relations of higher arity play a significant role,
then a visualisation is no longer feasible, as explained in Section~\ref{subsec:attributes+n-ary}.
In this case, it is possible to resort to a (technical and non-graphical)
SQL-like syntax, and the system can support non-computer scientist users by 
offering a graphical query editor that allows to pick, arrange, and link
the basic ingredients of queries as blocks.
Graphical SQL query builders exist in the form of online tools or standalone applications
\autocite[e.g.,][]{VisualSQL,SQLeo} and are reviewed on dedicated webpages
\autocite[e.g.,][]{ChartioVisualSQL}.

In the dynamic setting, it is possible to let the user
restrict the selection of repositories and thus the list of available terms.
This initial step is not useful in the static setting
because the graph encompasses all repositories selected in the configuration phases,
and a recomputation would certainly consume too much time.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    data source $=$ union of all available data sources (see ยง\ref{subsec:data_sources})
  \item
    distinguish \emph{dynamic} and \emph{static} method -- continue discussion
    from Sections~\ref{subsec:insights_from_SoNAR} and~\ref{sec:computational_properties}

    dynamic vs.\ static method:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        static: 
        
        data source graph is generated explicitly (using data integration techniques, e.g., LD)
        and updated in fixed intervals
                
        at runtime: provenance query is formulated as a \gls{SPARQL} query and posed against the graph
        
        learn from SoNAR insights
        
        reduction to SQL? use DB systems
      \item
        dynamic (preferred??):
        
        data source graph is implicit; data sources are queried \enquote{on the fly}
%        (this is the preferred scenario here; see delineation from SoNAR in ยง\ref{sec:HNA+SoNAR})
        
        data sources need to be defined and
        interactions with them programmed in advance
        
        at runtime: decompose query into single \gls{SPARQL} (sub)queries and pose them against several data sources,
        potentially iteratively;
        compose final answer from the partial answers
        $\leadsto$ demonstrate this for example query/ies!
      \item
        don't commit to dynamic method % (check mentions of \enquote{method}/\enquote{scenario}/\enquote{online}\enquote{off{}line} in text and rephrase if necessary)
      \item
        discuss pros and cons; connect to discussion in ยง\ref{sec:HNA+SoNAR}; reuse:
        
        More precisely, while our abstract model will centre around a single data source (graph)
        that represents the combination of the distributed repositories,
        our method will abstain from constructing that graph explicitly and, instead,
        answer queries \enquote{in place} over the original repositories.
        This way, our approach will not depend on hosting capacities,
        and it will always have direct access to the current content of the repositories.
        On the downside, our approach will depend on external web services provided by the repositories,
        and it will be sensitive to changes in their data models.
        Our dynamic approach also requires that inconsistencies are resolved
        a posteriori, i.e., every time a query answer is retrieved.
        As a final advantage, the dynamic approach is flexible
        in the sense that it can be applied to a static integrated data source as well,
        thus benefiting from the advantages of the static approach.

        missing vs.\ spurious answers

      \item
        \emph{reasoning}: ontologies and related technology -- also explain why
        missing knowledge cannot be added upfront, e.g., like this:
        
        Clearly, it would not be advisable to attempt adding all implicit knowledge to the data
        because that would massively inflate the data,
        as most terms have several superordinate concepts or relations and,
        furthermore, implicit knowledge is not restricted to taxonomic knowledge.
