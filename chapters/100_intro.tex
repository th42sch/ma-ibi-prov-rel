\todo[inline]{TODO: import from \emph{Exposé}}

We want to develop a method for answering provenance queries that refer to bibliographic entities, people, and corporations
as well as the relationships between those. This method should consult standard data sources such as 
library catalogues, authority files, and knowledge bases. The method should furthermore be implementable as a software tool
that supports the user in formulating their queries, answering them, and exploring the data that supports the query answers.
In the long term, we envisage that such a tool will support provenance research
by prospectively retrieving potentially interesting constellations.
