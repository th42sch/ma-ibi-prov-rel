\chapter{Automated Retrieval of Provenance Relationships}
\label{chap:retrieval}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    develop method for answering queries in the model just defined
  \item
    uniform vs.\ distributed scenario:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        uniform: formulate provenance query as a SPARQL query and pose that against the graph
      \item
        distributed: decompose query into single SPARQL (sub)queries and pose them against several data sources,
        potentially iteratively;
        data sources need to be identified upfront.
        $\leadsto$ demonstrate this for example query/ies!
