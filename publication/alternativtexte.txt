S. 24, Fig. 3.1
Part of an OPAC search result showing 8 provenance entries, including autographs, a handwritten note, and stamps. These entries are described in the preceding text.

S. 24, Fig. 3.2
Part of the GND entry for Johann Hommel, containing the individual's GND ID, the preferred name, years of birth and death, professions (mathematician, astronomer), and a reference to his student Valentin Thau.

S. 28, Fig. 4.1
FRBR entities and relations as described in the text above. Entities of Group 1 and 2 are on the left and right, respectively. Relations of the first kind are on the left; those of the second kind are between left and right.

S. 38, Fig. 5.1
A directed graph consisting of 5 nodes and 8 edges.

S. 39, Fig. 5.2
A directed graph with 5 nodes representing the objects and individuals described in the text above and their corresponding labels, plus the respective edges labelled with "exemplar", "creator", "owner", "student", "collaborator" (and their inverses).

S. 41, Fig. 5.3
The rectangle-shaped node "De revolutionibus" is labelled "Work" and has an "exemplar" edge to a round node x labelled "Item". Node x has two "owner" edges to diamond-shaped nodes y and z, where y is labelled "Scientist" and has a "student" edge to z.

S. 42, Fig. 5.4 (a)
Node "De revolutionibus" is labelled "Work" and has an "exemplar" edge to node "FB Gotha Druck 4° 00466", which is labelled "Item" and has 2 "owner" edges to nodes "Hommel", "Thau". Node "Hommel" is labelled "Scientist" and has a "student" edge to "Thau".

S. 42, Fig. 5.4 (b)
The graph from the previous subfigure, plus an additional converse "exemplarOf" edge, plus additional labels "Person" for node "Hommel" and "Person", "Scientist" for "Thau".

S. 42, Fig. 5.4 (c)
The graph from the first subfigure, minus the "student" edge from "Hommel" to "Thau".

S. 42, Fig. 5.4 (d)
The graph from the first subfigure, but with the first two nodes named "ABC" and "DEF".

S. 43, Fig. 5.5
The previous query graph on the left, the data graph from Figure 5.2 on the right, and four edges labelled h: from "De Revolutionibus" left to "De Revolutionibus" right, and from x, y, z to "FB Gotha Druck 4° 00466", "Hommel", "Thau", respectively.

S. 44, Fig. 5.6
The same as the previous figure, minus the node "Copernicus" and its incoming/outgoing edges. The query graph is slightly greyed out, putting the focus on the h edges and the remaining data graph, which together constitute the answer.

S. 46, Fig. 5.7
4 graphs depcting the above query patterns. E.g., the graph for Q1- has nodes X, y1, x1, y2, x2 labelled Work, Expression, Manifestation, Item, Person and connected, in this order, with a chain of edges labelled realization, embodiment, exemplar, owner.

S. 47, Fig. 5.8 (Q1)
A graph depicting the abobe query pattern Q1. The graph has two nodes y2, x2 labelled Item and Person, respectively, and an edge "owner : x3" from y2 to x2.

S. 47, Fig. 5.8 (Q5*)
A graph depicting the abobe query pattern Q5*. The graph has two nodes x, Y labelled Item and ResponsibleEntity, respectively, and an edge "provider : 1935" from x to Y.
