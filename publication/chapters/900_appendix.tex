\chapter{Research Data}
\label{chap:DMP}

The research data created during the work on the master's thesis underlying this study 
were generated, documented, and made accessible for at least 18 months
according to the guidelines for handling research data in theses
at the Institute of Library and Information Science at the 
\foreignlanguage{ngerman}{Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin}
\url{https://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/de/studium/rundumdasstudium/fdm-fuer-studierende/leitlinie_forschungsdaten_finale_version_dez_21-1.pdf} .

The research data is stored in two datasets in the open repository Zenodo:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    \url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8036824} (open access) with the following contents:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        a BibTeX file \verb!masters_thesis.bib! with the bibliographic metadata of all cited publications and websites
      \item
        a markdown file \verb!statistics_of_data_sources.md! containing statistics of the data sources reviewed in Chapter~\ref{chap:analysis}
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    \url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8036903} (closed access for licensing reasons) containing:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        a zip file \verb!Lit.zip! with full texts of a part of the cited publications
    \end{itemize}    
\end{itemize}

The research data is documented via a data management plan (in German),
which is stored in the cloud storage service \emph{HU-Box} of the \foreignlanguage{ngerman}{Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin}
and can be viewed and downloaded via the following URL: \url{https://box.hu-berlin.de/d/7aabcdcda32a42bda4dd/}
