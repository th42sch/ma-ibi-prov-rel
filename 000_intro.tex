\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    see Exposé
  \item
    Example queries:
    %
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[\exaquery{1}]
        Who read work $W$, in which manifestation and in which year?
      \item[\exaquery{2}]
        Which copies of work $W$ were passed from one of its owners to a collaborator (or student) of theirs?
      \item[\exaquery{3}]
        What are the relationships between the recipients of work $W$
        (or of manifestation $M$ of $W$ or of copy $C$ of $W$, respectively)?
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    Give concrete examples for \exaquery{1}--\exaquery{3}, with data sources and answers; explain how these queries differ from each other.
  \item
    In this thesis, focus on these three types of queries.
    This is a deliberate restriction of what one can generally ask – scope of master's thesis!
\end{itemize}
