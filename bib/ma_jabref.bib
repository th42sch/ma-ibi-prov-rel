OWL is heavily based on the knowledge representation languages called Description Logic, which provide the basic representation features of OWL. OWL also includes facilities that integrate it into the mainstream of the Web, including use of Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) as names, XML Schema datatypes, and ontologies as Web documents, which can then import other OWL ontologies over the Web. Because OWL is based on Description Logics, its constructs have a well-denned meaning and there are tools that effectively perform inference within OWL, enabling the discovery of information that is not explicitly stated in OWL ontologies.},

  abstract       = {Querying Linked Data is one of the most important issues for the semantic web community today because it requires the user to understand the structure and vocabularies used in various data sources. Furthermore, users must be familiar with the syntax of query languages, such as SPARQL. However, because users are accustomed to natural language-based search, novice users may find it challenging to use these features. As a result, new approaches for querying Linked Data sources on the web with NL queries must be defined. In this paper, we propose a novel system for converting natural language queries into SPARQL queries to query linked and heterogeneous semantic data on the web. While most existing methods have focused on simple queries and have ignored complex queries, the method described in this work aims to handle various types of NL queries, particularly complex queries containing negation, numbers, superlatives, and comparative adjectives. Three complementary strategies are used in this context: (1) identifying the semantic relations between query terms in order to understand the user&rsquo;s needs; (2) mapping the NL terms to semantic entities; and (3) constructing the query&rsquo;s valid triples based on the different links used to describe the identified entities in order to generate correct SPARQL queries. The empirical evaluations show that the proposed system is effective.},

  abstract = {Web technologies are the key for the implementing and ensuring the full range of user needs in the digital age. On the other hand, the issue of unified representation of digital content from diverse memory institutions in order to ensure semantic integrity still remains a matter of urgency. Semantic interoperability of information and data is essential in an integrated system. In this paper, we analyze and describe an ontology-based metadata interoperability approach and how this approach could be applied for memory institution data from diverse sources which do not support ontologies. In particular, we describe the use of the CIDOC CRM ontology as a mediating schema within Lithuania's Information System of the Virtual Electronic Heritage (hereinafter "VEPIS") The paper introduces the role of the CIDOC CRM based Thesaurus of Personal Names, Geographical Names and Historical Chronology (hereinafter "BAVIC"), which operates as a core ontology within VEPIS by allowing to understand things and relationships between things as well as identify the time and space of things. The paper also focuses on trust of the cultural information on the Web. Users make trust judgments based on provenance that may or may not be explicitly offered to them. In particular, we describe how provenance is managed within digital preservation and access processes within VEPIS and define whether this management meets the W3C Provenance Incubator Group's Requirements for Provenance on the Web. The paper is based on the results of the research initiated in 2018–2019 at the Faculty of Communication and the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics of Vilnius University by authors of this paper.Alternate abstract:Saityno technologijos sudaro galimybę tenkinti įvairiapusiškas informacines skaitmeninės eros vartotojų reikmes.

Informacijos ir duomenų turinio semantinis suderinamumas ypač aktualus integruotoms sistemoms. Straipsnyje apibūdinama ontologijomis grindžiamų metaduomenų koncepcija. Straipsnyje aprašomas CIDOC/CRM ontologijos kaip tarpininkavimo schemos vaidmuo VEPIS sistemoje. Straipsnis taip pat supažindina su Asmenvardžių, vietovardžių ir istorinės chronologijos tezauru (BAVIC), VEPIS atliekančiu pamatinės ontologijos vaidmenį (leidžia suprasti esybes ir jų santykius, jų santykį su laiku ir erdve).

  abstract       = {Online cultural heritage resources are widely available through digital libraries maintained by numerous organizations. In order to improve discoverability in cultural heritage, the typical approach is metadata aggregation, a method where centralized efforts such as Europeana improve the discoverability by collecting resource metadata. The redefinition of the traditional data models for cultural heritage resources into data models based on semantic technology has been a major activity of the cultural heritage community. Yet, linked data may bring new innovation opportunities for cultural heritage metadata aggregation. We present the outcomes of a case study that we conducted within the Europeana cultural heritage network. In this study, the National Library of The Netherlands contributed by providing the role of data provider, while the Dutch Digital Heritage Network contributed as an intermediary aggregator that aggregates datasets and provides them to Europeana, the central aggregator. We identified and analyzed the requirements for an aggregation solution for the linked data, guided by current aggregation practices of the Europeana network. These requirements guided the definition of a workflow that fulfils the same functional requirements as the existing one. The workflow was put into practice within this study and has led to the development of software applications for administrating datasets, crawling the web of data, harvesting linked data, data analysis and data integration. We present our analysis of the study outcomes and analyze the effort necessary, in terms of technology adoption, to establish a linked data approach, from the point of view of both data providers and aggregators. We also present the expertise requirements we identified for cultural heritage data analysts, as well as determining which supporting tools were required to be designed specifically for semantic data.},

  abstract = {Data Modeling, Transformation, and Aggregation MMM combines data from three specialist databases, each with a focus on the history and provenance of medieval and Renaissance manuscripts: * The Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts (SDBM): a relational database containing more than 240,000 records for manuscript observations4 * Bibale: a relational database containing nearly 13,000 manuscript records5 * Medieval Manuscripts in Oxford Libraries: a collection of more than 10,000 XML documents6 Since each of these data sources is governed by its own customized data model, it was necessary to construct a unified data model that would be able to transform the underlying structures of the three data sets to allow them to function cooperatively in the MMM environment. Working over a period of eighteen months, the Modelling Group's first tasks were to identify the requirements of manuscript provenance researchers, analyze the data models in the source data sets, and compare them with the International Council for Documentation Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC-CRM) and Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records-object oriented (FRBROO) ontologies.7 Applying the MMM data model to the transformation pipeline proved to be more complicated than initially expected, but the iterative, trial-and-error process of applying the model revealed refinements throughout the process that would better support use and discovery in the final product. The transparent relationship between the source data sets and the MMM data underscores the role of MMM as an aggregator of data rather than as a data management system, though an unanticipated but welcome outcome has been its ability to help managers of the original data sets to identify problems. Because data correction is not part of the MMM transformation process, weaknesses, inconsistencies, and errors in the data sets become baldly apparent in search results, alerting data set managers to the need for a fix at their end. A SPARQL endpoint enables all the RDF triples to be searched directly using the SPARQL query language.13 In addition to SPARQL queries, the data service supports the best practices of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for publishing Linked Data, including the following types of data access mechanisms:14 * Resolving Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) * Viewing the RDF description of a URI * Linked Data browsing starting from a URI * Downloading the data If this URI/URL is used in a browser, a human-readable view of the data resource is rendered.},

  abstract = {Linked Open Data (LOD) is a core Semantic Web technology that makes knowledge and information spaces of different knowledge domains manageable, reusable, shareable, exchangeable, and interoperable. The LOD approach achieves this through the provision of services for describing, indexing, organizing, and retrieving knowledge artifacts and making them available for quick consumption and publication. This is also aligned with the role and objective of traditional library cataloging. Owing to this link, major libraries of the world are transferring their bibliographic metadata to the LOD landscape. Some developments in this direction include the replacement of Anglo-American Cataloging Rules 2nd Edition by the Resource Description and Access (RDA) and the trend towards the wider adoption of BIBFRAME2.0. An interesting and related development in this respect are the discussions among knowledge resources managers and library community on the possibility of enriching bibliographic metadata with socially curated or user-generated content. The popularity of Linked Open Data and its benefit to librarians and knowledge management professionals warrant a comprehensive survey of the subject. Although several reviews and survey articles on the application of Linked Data principles to cataloging have appeared in literature, a generic yet holistic review of the current state of Linked and Open Data in cataloging is missing. To fill the gap, the authors have collected recent literature (2014-18) on the current state of Linked Open Data in cataloging to identify research trends, challenges, and opportunities in this area and, in addition, to understand the potential of socially curated metadata in cataloging mainly in the realm of the Web of Data. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this review article is the first of its kind that holistically treats the subject of cataloging in the Linked and Open Data environment. Some of the findings of the review are: Linked and Open Data is becoming the mainstream trend in library cataloging especially in the major libraries and research projects of the world; with the emergence of Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV), the bibliographic metadata is becoming more meaningful and reusable; and, finally, enriching bibliographic metadata with user-generated content is gaining momentum. Conclusions drawn from the study include the need for a focus on the quality of catalogued knowledge and the reduction of the barriers to the publication and consumption of such knowledge, and the attention on the part of library community to the learning from the successful adoption of LOD in other application domains and contributing collaboratively to the global scale activity of cataloging.},

Create a common interface for integration of these four metadata vocabulary standards with Omeka as fulfilling the item relationships from different collections. It also explores some scripts and semantic web scale services using digital object identifiers, uniform resource identifier, and uniform resource locations. However, users have very much benefited from using this semantic web technologies to designing and developing domain specific cultural heritage resources with the help of basic system integrated framework on the basis of global recommendations and local requirements as per metadata vocabularies. Now the whole integrated framework is designed on Ubuntu Operating System and LAMP architecture. This framework is very useful and effective for the users.},

  abstract = {Social network analysis (SNA) is not a formal theory in sociology but rather a strategy for investigating social structures. As it is an idea that can be applied in many fields, we study, in particular, its influence in the information sciences. Information scientists study publication, citation and co-citation networks, collaboration structures and other forms of social interaction networks. Moreover, the Internet represents a social network of an unprecedented scale. In all these studies social network analysis can successfully be applied. SNA is further related to recent theories concerning the free market economy, geography and transport networks. The growth of SNA is documented and a co-author network of SNA is drawn. Centrality measures of the SNA network are calculated.},

More recently, "social network analysis" has developed into a complete academic concept for the analysis of social structures through a focus on relations between individuals. Many of the theories, methods, tools and software which have emerged over the last thirty years could stimulate and aid historical research in diverse fields. This essay discusses the wide range of current research and introduces the key concepts and methods underlying "historical network research" (HNR). It concludes with two case studies which show how HNR can lead to completely new insights.},

  abstractnote = {&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Given that the amount of available digital sources is constantly growing, studies on the acquisition and transmission of knowledge in the public sphere tend to be methodologically selective in their analysis of historical discourses. These studies, as a rule, tend to offer a very partial image from an intellectual history perspective of the production, representation, reception, and evaluation of knowledge. A more productive approach would be to analyse the ways in which pre-modern knowledge production functioned based on the broadest possible sample of sources. The project will seek, with a computer-based methodology, to consistently compile and systematically analyse all 356 journals and periodicals published in Halle between 1688 and 1815, as well as to gather information on all the actors participating in the process (authors, editors, printers et cetera). The periodical press of the Enlightenment is particularly relevant for this type of approach. Newspapers and periodicals allowed for a broader circulation of the ideas of the educated and for faster reactions to news, controversies, and publications, as they became a widely accepted form of interpersonal communication. They thus filled a public and institutional gap and provided an open and adaptable medium for various public discourses without thematic limitations. We qualitatively go beyond standard discourse analysis by using a wealth of text and network data digitally available to reconstruct the breadth and depth of all the types of discourses of the Enlightenment, the combined quantitative methods for text and network analysis will allow us to trace the impact of the many involved parties right into the structure of the discourses.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},

Inhaltserschließende Informationen wie Klassifikation oder verbale Erschließung, ebenso wie Normdatenverknüpfungen, können so auf alle Mitglieder eines Bündels übertragen werden, so dass ein Gewinn an Standardisierung und Erschließungstiefe zu erreichen ist.

  abstract  = {In this paper we present a statistical method for inferring historical social networks from biographical documents as well as the scholarly aims for doing so. Existing scholarship on historical social networks is scattered across an unmanageable number of disparate books and articles. A researcher interested in how persons were connected to one another in our field of study, early modern Britain (c. 1500-1700), has no global, unified resource to which to turn. Manually building such a network is infeasible, since it would need to represent thousands of nodes and tens of millions of potential edges just to include the relations among the most prominent persons of the period. Our Six Degrees of Francis Bacon project takes up recent statistical techniques and digital tools to reconstruct and visualize the early modern social network. We describe in this paper the natural language processing tools and statistical graph learning techniques that we used to extract names and infer relations from the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. We then explain the steps taken to test inferred relations against the knowledge of experts in order to improve the accuracy of the learning techniques. Our argument here is twofold: first, that the results of this process, a global visualization of Britain’s early modern social network, will be useful to scholars and students of the period; second, that the pipeline we have developed can, with local modifications, be reused by other scholars to generate networks for other historical or contemporary societies from biographical documents.},

This specification does not define a generative grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual specifications of each URI scheme. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},

  abstract  = {SPARQL – Simple Protocol And RDF Query Language – is the language, proposed by W3C, for querying RDF data published on the Web, both stored natively or viewed via middleware. SPARQL offers a syntactically SQL-like language for querying RDF graphs via pattern matching, as well as a simple communication protocol that can be used by clients for issuing SPARQL queries against endpoints.
The first section provides the reader with a scientific and technical overview of the SPARQL query language. Basic concepts, such as the notions of triple and graph patterns are presented first. The section, then, shows how to write simple queries, and progressively introduces the reader to the full expressive power of SPARQL.
The second section illustrates some examples of applications, progressing in a quasi-chronological order. It starts with “early days” applications, when RDF data were lacking and the Semantic Web practitioners applied semantic technologies to bibliographic and conference data. Next, it moves on to “first uptakes” in the area of bioscience, which can be considered as the earlier science adopting Semantic Web technologies. This section is concluded by the presentation of some large applications, showing SPARQL queries that nowadays can be issued against interlinked RDF repositories about music and about governmental data.
The third section is dedicated to SPARQL implementations, in particular to those ones that are mostly used and widely deployed. It also discusses the standard compliance of the implementations, based upon the W3C test suite.
Finally, the fourth section discusses some of the issues that characterize the current development of SPARQL. It presents foreseen extensions to the query language, in particular a proposal for remotely updating RDF graphs, four vocabularies for describing SPARQL endpoints, the behavior of SPARQL under different entailment regimes, three approaches for querying the entire Semantic Web with SPARQL, and three proposals for extending SPARQL to the management of streams of rapidly flowing information.},

  abstract  = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide recommendations for making a conceptual shift from current document-centric to data-centric metadata. The importance of adjusting current library models such as Resource Description and Access (RDA) and Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) to models based on Linked Data principles is discussed. In relation to technical formats, the paper suggests the need to leapfrog from machine readable cataloguing (MARC) to Resource Description Framework (RDF), without disrupting current library metadata operations. Design/methodology/approach - This paper identified and reviewed relevant works on overarching topics that include standards-based metadata, Web 2.0 and Linked Data. The review of these works is contextualised to inform the recommendations identified in this paper. Articles were retrieved from databases such as Emerald and D-Lib Magazine. Books, electronic articles and relevant blog posts were also used to support the arguments put forward in this paper. Findings - Contemporary library standards and models carried forward some of the constraints from the traditional card catalogue system. The resultant metadata are mainly attuned to human consumption rather than machine processing. In view of current user needs and technological development such as the interest in Linked Data, it is found important that current metadata models such as FRBR and RDA are re-conceptualised. Practical implications - This paper discusses the implications of re-conceptualising current metadata models in light of Linked Data principles, with emphasis on metadata sharing, facilitation of serendipity, identification of Zeitgeist and emergent metadata, provision of faceted navigation, and enriching metadata with links. Originality/value - Most of the literature on Linked Data for libraries focus on answering the "how to" questions of using RDF/XML and SPARQL technologies, however, this paper focuses mainly on answering "why" Linked Data questions, thus providing an underlying rationale for using Linked Data. The discussion on mixed-metadata approaches, serendipity, Zeitgeist and emergent metadata is considered to provide an important rationale to the role of Linked Data for libraries.},
